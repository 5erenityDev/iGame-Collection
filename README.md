## Final Group Project for CSC 308
This project was created with a group of 3 people during the Fall 2022 semester. Originally we had 4 members but one of the members dropped the class unexpectedly so I ended up volunteering to pick up the work they left behind.

## The Team and their responsibilities
I, Sean Blankenship, worked on the memory matching game and was repsonsible for all of the User Interface.
Andrew Rhoton was responsible for the Blackjack game.
Asumi Mizoguchi was responsible for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
